        <p>Hello!</p> 
        <p>My name is John.  Not long ago, I retired from the healthcare industry after 25 rewarding years 
            as a Magnetic Resonance Imaging Technologist.  I fiddled around with different smaller jobs mostly working
            outdoors, but soon felt I was missing something.  Knowing I still have a lot to contribute, the ambitious side of 
            me started snooping around computer programming as this has always piqued my interest.  After a little research, I 
            decided to enroll in a Full-Stack Web Development program offered at Denver University.  I hope to find a career 
            in web development after successful completion of the course.  Ideally, I would love to be able 
            to work remotely.  This career is how I intend to spend the remainder of my working life and I look forward 
            to an exciting future with many options!
